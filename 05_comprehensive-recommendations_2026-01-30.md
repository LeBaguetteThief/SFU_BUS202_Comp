## SECTION 3: MARKETING DECISIONS

### 3.1 PRODUCT (R&D) ⚠️ NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

### Current State:
| Setting | Current | Recommended | Gap |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **R&D Staff** | 2 researchers | 4 researchers | -2 staff |
| **R&D Budget** | 90% ($450K) | 100% ($500K) | -$50K |
| **R&D Machine** | ✅ Purchased | ✅ Purchased | Complete |
| **Green Mfg** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | Complete |
| **Cost Reduction Research** | 0% | 20% | Not set |
| **Reliability Research** | 0% | 30% | Not set |
| **Quality Research** | 0% | 25% | Not set |
| **Innovation Research** | 0% | 25% | Not set |

### Recommendations:

#### A. Increase R&D Staff: 2 → 4
**Cost:** Additional ~$120K/year (2 more staff × $60K)
**Why:**
- Unlocks faster research progress
- Supports 6★ quality target (need 2nd place out of 5)
- More researchers = more projects completed simultaneously
- Contributes to Staff Education target (80%)

**ROI:** Faster quality unlock = premium pricing sooner = +$200K+ revenue

#### B. Increase R&D Budget: 90% → 100%
**Cost:** Additional $50K/year
**Why:**
- Currently at 90%, missing $50K of optimal budget
- Below 90% drops effectiveness to 85%
- Every dollar drives innovation faster

#### C. Set Research Time Allocation (Total 100%):
| Research Project | Allocation | Reason |
|------------------|------------|---------|
| **Quality Research** | 40% | #1 Priority - unlock 6-7★ stars for 2nd place target |
| **Innovation Research** | 35% | Product Development strategy - new model launch |
| **Reliability Research** | 15% | Customer Intimacy - fewer defects = happier customers |
| **Cost Reduction** | 10% | Lower priority - already have good margins |

**Total:** 100% allocation across 4 projects

**Why this allocation:**
1. **Quality (40%)** - Your highest priority is "Highest Quality: 2nd place" target
2. **Innovation (35%)** - Product Development growth strategy requires new products
3. **Reliability (15%)** - Supports Customer Intimacy (happy customers)
4. **Cost Reduction (10%)** - Nice to have, but already profitable

**Total R&D Investment Recommended:**
- Staff (4): ~$240K
- Budget (100%): ~$100K  
- Machine: $500K (one-time, already purchased)
- **Year 1 Total:** ~$840K
- **Annual ongoing:** ~$340K

---

### 3.2 PRICE ⚠️ MINOR ADJUSTMENT NEEDED

### Current State:
| Product | Price | Cost | Margin | Status |
|---------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| **Men** | $50 | ~$30 | 40% | ✅ Low (not competing) |
| **Women** | $85 | ~$34 | 60% | ✅ **OPTIMAL** |
| **Kids** | $70 | ~$30 | 57% | ⚠️ Could lower |

### Recommendations:

#### Women: Keep at $85 ✅
**Status:** Perfect - supports Customer Intimacy premium positioning

#### Men: Keep at $50 ✅  
**Status:** Low price appropriate for inactive segment

#### Kids: Lower to $50 ⚠️
**Change:** $70 → $50
**Why:**
- You're not actively selling Kids (0/0 order limits)
- $70 is high for a non-strategic segment
- Lower to $50 to liquidate any accidental sales
- Focus all pricing power on Women ($85)

**Financial Impact:** Minimal (Kids inactive), but better positioning

---

### 3.3 PLACE ✅ OPTIMAL

### Current State:
**Distribution:** Selective Distribution ✅

### Recommendations:
**Status:** ✅ **OPTIMAL - No changes**

**Why Selective is perfect:**
- Quality market positioning ✓
- Customer relationship focus ✓  
- Supports $85 premium pricing ✓
- 2nd place quality target achievable ✓

---

### 3.4 PROMOTION ⚠️ MAJOR OPTIMIZATION NEEDED

### Current State:
| Channel | Current | Annual Cost | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **SEO** | Not selected | $0 | ❌ Missing |
| **AdWords** | $2.10/click | $42,000 | ✅ Reasonable |
| **Social Networks** | $50,000/month | $600,000 | ❌ **WRONG AUDIENCE** |
| **LinkedIn** | $25,000/month | $300,000 | ✅ Good but could increase |
| **Offline Activities** | None selected | $0 | ⚠️ Missing opportunity |

### Recommendations:

#### A. SEO: Select "Extended" ⚠️
**Cost:** $25,000/year (one-time)
**Why:**
- Organic traffic = long-term value
- High-intent customers searching for quality sneakers
- Supports Customer Intimacy (customers find you when researching)
- One-time cost, continuous benefit

**ROI:** +$50K-100K revenue from organic search

#### B. AdWords: Keep or Slightly Increase ✅
**Current:** $2.10/click × 20,000 clicks = $42,000
**Recommended:** $2.50/click × 20,000 clicks = $50,000
**Additional Cost:** +$8,000/year
**Why:**
- Captures high-intent searchers
- Worth paying more per click for quality customers

#### C. Social Networks: MAJOR REDUCTION ❌❌❌
**Current:** $50,000/month = $600,000/year
**Recommended:** $10,000/month = $120,000/year
**SAVINGS:** $480,000/year!

**Why reduce:**
- Social networks target "young people looking for bargains"
- ❌ **WRONG AUDIENCE** for your strategy!
- You're Customer Intimacy + Quality, not bargain hunting
- $600K is massive waste on wrong demographic

**Reallocate saved $480K to better channels**

#### D. LinkedIn: INCREASE ⭐⭐⭐
**Current:** $25,000/month = $300,000/year
**Recommended:** $35,000/month = $420,000/year (+$120K)

**Why increase:**
- LinkedIn targets "business people looking for quality"
- ✅ **PERFECT AUDIENCE** for $85 premium sneakers!
- High-income professionals match your pricing
- Supports Customer Intimacy (professional relationships)
- Better ROI than social networks

**Source of funds:** Reallocate from Social ($480K saved)

#### E. Offline Activities: Select 4 ⚠️
**Current:** None selected
**Recommended Budget:** ~$200,000/year for 4 activities

**Select these 4:**
1. ✅ **Magazines** ($60K) - Premium publications = quality positioning
2. ✅ **Trade Fair** ($80K) - Direct customer interaction = relationship building
3. ⚠️ **Billboards** ($40K) - Brand awareness, wide reach
4. ⚠️ **Television** ($20K spot) - Limited but quality channels

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Flyers (too mass-market)
- ❌ Radio (audio-only, no visual quality showcase)
- ❌ Newspaper (general audience, not targeted)

**Why these 4:**
- Magazines + Trade Fair align with Customer Intimacy
- Billboards = brand prestige
- TV = broad reach for product launch

### Summary - Marketing Budget Reallocation:

| Channel | Current | Recommended | Change | Annual Cost |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **SEO** | $0 | Extended | +$25K | $25,000 |
| **AdWords** | $42K | $50K | +$8K | $50,000 |
| **Social** | $600K | $120K | **-$480K** | $120,000 |
| **LinkedIn** | $300K | $420K | **+$120K** | $420,000 |
| **Offline (4)** | $0 | $200K | +$200K | $200,000 |
| **TOTAL** | $942K | $815K | **-$127K** | **$815,000** |

**Result:** $127K savings + better targeting = higher ROI!
